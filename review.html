                <h3>At 100, Shows Modern Car’s Quality, Safety.</h3>
                <p>PARIS Some economic Cassandras predict the Western world is about to revert to the living standards of a century ago, so it’s a good time to find out what it would be like living with the first production motor car, the Ford Model T, which first clanked out of a factory in Detroit, Michigan on October 1, 1908. </p>
                <p>(I’d have thought that Ford would have wanted to demonstrate the depth of its heritage by showing one on its Paris Car Show stand. But it didn’t. It might have diverted attention from its nifty new little Ka.)</p>
                <p>First, the good news. 100 years ago the price was only $850, although that translates into a figure unaffordable to ordinary people today. You wouldn’t have needed to buy a burglar alarm; the car was so complicated to drive, even the lack of doors would have still made it untouchable to most thieves.</p>
                <p>The Model T, like a modern car, had three pedals on the floor, but there the similarity ends. The accelerator is a lever on the right side of the steering wheel. The pedal on the left is the clutch for the two forward gears, the pedal in the middle engages reverse, and the one on the right is the brake. There was no starter button. To fire the engine you muscled the crank handle at the front of the car, taking care it didn’t kick back and break your wrist. Another good idea was to engage the powerful hand brake; that made sure the car didn’t fire up and run over you.</p>
